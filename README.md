# Slangroom Web Example

Welcome to the Slangroom Web Example repository! This repository serves as a demonstration of using Slangroom, a dialect of the Zencode language, within a simple web page. Slangroom is designed to enhance Zenroom smart contracts with a more accessible and user-friendly syntax.

## Getting Started

To get started with this example, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dyne/slangroom-web-example.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

   ```bash
   cd slangroom-web-example
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

4. You should now see a simple web page demonstrating the usage of Slangroom within a web environment.

## About Slangroom

[Slangroom](https://github.com/dyne/slangroom/) is a dialect of the Zenroom/Zencode language, developed by Dyne.org. It aims to provide a more user-friendly and intuitive syntax for writing smart contracts, making them more accessible to developers and non-developers alike.

## About Zenroom

[Zenroom](https://github.com/dyne/zenroom/) is a software library and virtual machine that executes scripts written in the Zencode language. It is primarily designed for cryptographic operations and secure execution of smart contracts.

## Usage

In this example, we showcase how Slangroom can be integrated into a simple web page. The provided `index.html` file includes a basic HTML structure with embedded JavaScript to demonstrate the execution of Slangroom scripts.

To experiment with Slangroom, you can modify the `script` tag inside the `index.html` file. Replace the existing Slangroom script with your own, then refresh the web page to see the updated output.
